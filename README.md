Wakatime token
Smart time release program
That's all
Set up

Open app at first go to the settings window
Paste your wakatime token
Write your daily work time (in a format HH: mm)
Chose the apps which you want to block (it can be shortcuts or .exe files)
Press the save button
6.Update your time in main window
How it works
Every 15 minutes, the program checks if the blocked tasks are. If you open an app that is blocked, the program automatically closes it and starts doing more intensive checks. You can also open the program from the tray.
